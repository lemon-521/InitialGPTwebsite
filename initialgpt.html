<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Requirements errors are one of the reasons for the failure of computer software projects, and in serious cases, they can cause great disasters. With the rapid development of information technology, the requirements of computer software systems become
    increasingly complex and variable. Traditional methods of requirements validation, such as the preparation of requirements documents and requirements review meetings, are not only inefficient, but also susceptible to human factors, resulting in insufficient
    accuracy and completeness of requirements validation.</p>
<p>Rapid prototyping, as an effective requirement validation method, helps development teams and stakeholders to better understand and validate the requirements by rapidly building runnable software prototypes. The current state-of-the-art method RM2PT is
    able to rapidly model software prototypes from formal requirements in UML diagrams by Generate software prototype systems, complemented by system operation contracts in Object Constraint Language (OCL), enabling customers to visually validate their
    requirements, thus easily discovering misunderstandings and uncertainties in the requirements.</p>
<p>However, these generated software prototypes do not contain any initial data. Software prototype data generation has been a key bottleneck in the prototyping process, and traditional approaches usually rely on hiring domain experts to manually write the
    prototype data for requirements validation of software prototypes. This is not only complex, time-consuming, inefficient and costly to manually write, but also difficult to meet the requirements of rapid iteration due to low user feedback iteration
    efficiency and high tendency to introduce human errors.</p>
<p>Inspired by the success of language models in text generation, we propose a data generation method,
    <strong>InitialGPT</strong>.
</p>
<p>Based on the above challenges, this research aims to propose an automatic software prototype data generation method to aid requirements validation InitialGPT, which improves the efficiency and accuracy of rapid prototyping to validate requirements by
    automatically generating initial data that meets the requirements without the need for time-consuming and laborious handwriting and manual inputs, and thus improves the quality of software.</p>

<!-- <h2>InitialGPT</h2>
<p><strong>InitialGPT</strong> is a data generation tool <strong>based on the RM2PT requirements prototyping tool and large language models</strong> aimed at automating the generation of initial data for prototypes to support rapid requirements validation.</p>
<h3>Features</h3>
<p><strong>Automatic generation of prompt templates</strong>: On the one hand, InitialGPT extracts domain conceptual information from the requirement model, on the other hand, the tool automatically generates requirement information through interaction with the user, and finally generates prompt templates by combining other pre-processed information.</p>
<p><strong>Automatic data generation and post-processing</strong>: We design a method to cope with the limitations of api request length and request number of LLMs, and perform data cleansing and re-generation by setting up post-processing rules to ensure that a large amount of reasonable initial data is generated without duplication.</p>
<p><strong>Data Evaluation</strong>: We propose a set of initial data generation evaluation metrics oriented to requirements validation to ensure data quality.</p>
 -->


<h2>InitialGPT Contribution</h2>
<strong>Generation of Prototype Initial Data<strong>: In our approach, we design a framework for automatically generating initial data for software prototypes by parsing the requirements model, which includes a prompt generation template, a data generation model, a data evaluation model, and several data post-processing tools to improve data quality. In addition, the code generated by this approach is integrated into the prototype to facilitate user interaction to acquire user requirements.
<strong>Intelligent Model-Driven Approach<strong>: We propose an Intelligent Model-Driven Approach (IMDA), an IMDA-based prototype data generation methodology that aims to overcome the bottlenecks in the traditional prototype data generation process by combining the advantages of model-driven development with intelligent agents and automation tools, and to facilitate the automation and intelligence of the software development process, thus improve the adaptability and intelligence of the system.
<strong>Prototype Data Evaluation Benchmarks<strong>: We propose a benchmark for assessing the data quality of software prototypes based on requirements validation for automatically assessing the data quality during data generation, facilitating user reviews and iterations, and examine the effectiveness of the benchmark in four case studies.

<h3>Input of InitialGPT — Requirements Model</h3>
<img src="./imgs/inputgen/InitialGPT_Overview_10.png" alt="InitialGPT_Overview_10" width="50%" height="50%">
<img src="./imgs/inputgen/rm.png" alt="rm" width="80%" height="80%">
<p>The input to InitialGPT is a UML requirements model with OCL constraints. The model includes: a conceptual class diagram, a use case diagram, system sequence diagrams, contracts of and system operations.</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <p><strong>A conceptual class diagram:</strong> A conceptual class diagram is a concept-relation model, which illustrates abstract and meaningful concepts and their relations in the problem domain, in which the concepts are specified as classes,
            the relations of the concepts are specified as the associations between the classes, and the properties of the concepts are specified as the attributes of the classes.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p><strong>A use case diagram:</strong> A use case diagram captures domain processes as use cases in terms of interactions between the system and its users. It contains a set of use cases for a system, actors represented a type of users of the system
            or external systems that the system interacts with, the relations between the actors and these use cases, and relations among use cases.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p><strong>System sequence diagrams:</strong> A system sequence diagram describes a particular domain process of a use case. It contains the actors that interact with the system, the system and the system events that the actors generate, their order,
            and inter-system events. Compared with the sequence diagram in design models, a system sequence diagram treats all systems as a black box and contains system events across the system boundary between actors and systems without object lifelines
            and internal interactions between objects.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p><strong>Contracts of system operations:</strong> The contract of a system operation specifies the conditions that the state of the system is assumed to satisfy before the execution of the system operation, called the pre-condition and the conditions
            that the system state is required to satisfy after the execution (if it terminated), called the post-condition of the system operation. Typically, the pre-condition specifies the properties of the system state that need to be checked when
            system operation is to be executed, and the postcondition defines the possible changes that the execution of the system operation is to realize.</p>
    </li>
</ul>
<h3>Input of InitialGPT — Prompt Template</h3>
<p>A good prompt template approach is the key to data generation, which can effectively prompt the large language model to generate data so as to better utilize the performance of the large model.</p>
<p>Since LLMs has the limitation of data response time and length for the api usage, we have designed two sets of templates for LLMs, which are used for generating general amount of data and large amount of data respectively.</p>
<img src="./imgs/inputgen/InitialGPT_Overview11.png.png" alt="InitialGPT_Overview11" width="70%" height="70%">
<h3>Prompt Template</h3>
<!-- <p>We have designed a corresponding prompt generation template as shown in the figure:</p>
<img src="./img/inputgen/new15.png" alt="InitialGPT_Overview11" width="80%" height="80%"> -->
<h4>General Prompt Template</h4>
<p>The general prompt template consists of three main components. The Initial Information Prompt is a well-tested general prompt, the Input section consists of user interaction information and domain entity information automatically generated by the requirements
    model, and the Output section specifies the format of the output data.
    <img src="./imgs/inputgen/GeneralFarmat.png" alt="GeneralFarmat" width="50%" height="70%"></p>
<h4>Large Prompt Template</h4>
<p>The Large Data Amount Prompt Template is similar to the General Prompt Template, but is generated for a single entity, 40 at one time, and post-processed until the final required number is fully generated.
    <img src="./imgs/inputgen/largeFarmat.png" alt="largeFarmat" width="50%" height="70%"></p>
<h3>1) Generate a prototype from the requirement model</h3>
<p>After you import a requirements model, first, we use the RM2PT to generate a prototype from the requirements model by right click on <code>cocome.remodel</code> -&gt; <code>RM2PT</code>-&gt; <code>OO Prototype</code>-&gt; <code> Generate Desktop Prototype</code></p>
<img src="./imgs/inputgen/10generateprototype.png" alt="10generateprototype" width="50%" height="70%">
<h3>2) Run the InitialGPT tool to refactor and enhance the prototype</h3>
<p>after you generate a prototype, we use the InitialGPT to refactor the prototype from the requirements model by right click on <code>cocome.remodel</code> -&gt; <code>RM2PT-dev</code>-&gt; <code>InitialGPT</code>, and update the project.</p>
<img src="./imgs/inputgen/InitialGPT9refactor.png" alt="InitialGPT9refactor" width="50%" height="70%">
<h3>3) The third step is to run the refactored prototype</h3>
<p>Run the refactored prototype to validate the requirements by right click on <code>COCOMEPrototype</code> -&gt; <code>pom.xml</code>-&gt; <code>run</code>-&gt; <code>maven build</code> .
    <img src="./imgs/inputgen/8runprototype.png" alt="8runprototype" width="50%" height="70%"></p>
<h3>4) Generate the initial data to validate the requirements.</h3>
<h3>The Output of InitialGPT</h3>
<p>After automatically refactoring and enhancing the generated prototype by the tool InitialGPT, the enhanced prototype contains two advantages as follows:</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <p><strong>Automatic initial data generation of prototypes</strong>. The enhanced prototypes can automatically generate large amounts of prototype initial data for requirements validation via a large language model.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p><strong>Automatic Data Prompts Generation for large language models</strong>. A method is proposed to automatically generate prompts for large language models based on the requirement model, aiming to prompt GPT-3.5 to generate more compliant,
            reasonable, and effective data that satisfies the requirements.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p><strong>Automated evaluation of generated data</strong>. To facilitate users in quickly understanding data quality, we have designed an automatic evaluation feature based on specific metrics.</p>
    </li>
</ul>

<h3>InitialGPT Evalution</h3>
<h4>Case Studies</h4>
<p>In this section, we first present the case studies and then show the evaluation results based on the case studies.</p>
<p>This paragraph discusses the reuse of four case studies to demonstrate the validity and functionality of InitialGPT. The case studies include systems that are widely used in daily life, namely a supermarket system (CoCoME), a library management system
    (LibMS), an automated teller machine (ATM) and a loan processing system (LoanPS). More details of the requirements models can be found at GitHub <a href="https://github.com/RM2PT/CaseStudies">https://github.com/RM2PT/CaseStudies</a>.</p>
<p>The complexity of these requirement models is shown in Table 1. InitialGPT's experimental settings are 2.8GHz Intel Core i5, 16GB DDR3, JDK 11 (JDK 11 has been embedded directly into RM2PT). The large model is tested using the api of gpt-4o,gpt-4 and
    gpt-3.5-turbo. We have a concise training on utilizing CASE tools for requirements validation.</p>
<img src="./imgs/inputgen/InitialGPT_table1.png" alt="InitialGPT_table1" width="50%" height="70%">
<h4>Evaluation Results</h4>
<p>In this section, we first present the case studies and then show the evaluation indicators with evaluation results based on the case studies.</p>
<h4>Efficiency Experments：</h4>
<p>InitialGPT can refactor the prototype generated by RM2PT in combination with gpt to automatically generate the initial data. In order to assess effectiveness, we conducte a comparison between two versions:</p>
<p>(1) <strong>The prototype generated by RM2PT tool</strong> and (2) <strong>The improved prototype that refactoring by InitialGPT</strong>.</p>
<p>The experiments involve validating requirements through the generation of initial data using InitialGPT or manual writing of initial data. The results of the experiments are shown in Table II.</p>
<img src="./imgs/inputgen/InitialGPT_table2.png" alt="InitialGPT_table2" width="50%" height="70%">
<p>We calculate the time efficiency of using the prototype for requirements validation. As shown in Table 3 on average, it takes a developer <strong>29.37 minutes to write 100 initial entities data, while ChatGPT takes only 2.96 minutes to automatically generate</strong>,
    and the enhanced prototype is able to **improve the efficiency of requirements validation by 6x times **over a manually written prototype, and <strong>the more initial data required, the more time is saved</strong>.</p>
